## Blockchain Voting App
This is a group project for a software engineering class at FHSU. This web app will allow users to vote in elections in a safe and transparent way.

## Motivation
The reason we're using blockchain is that it allows election officials and users to track the results of the election. This ensures that elections are safe and free of outside manipulation.

## Build status
Currently in the design phase for the app, working on an initial demo.

## Tech/framework used
We will be using the MEVN framework:
- [MongoDB](https://www.mongodb.com/)
- [Express](https://expressjs.com/)
- [Vue](https://vuejs.org/)
- [Node](https://nodejs.org/en/)

## API Reference
More to come in the future. There may be a future API that allows users to observe election results.
